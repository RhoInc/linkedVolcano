## Background
A volcano plot a popular visualization for assessing effect size against statistical significance, especially in omics research, which is typified by dense data sets where tools are needed to extract signals of interest from the “noise” of the data.  The typical volcano plot design charts logarithmic p-values on the y-axis with a measure of effect (e.g., odds ratio, fold change) plotted on the x-axis.  The resulting chart commonly displays a parabolic data distribution (giving the appearance of a volcano erupting), which effectively emphasizes the data points that have a high degree of statistical significance by visually separating them from the non-significant data.
